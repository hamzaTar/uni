22- it it does not show a linear compartment, and that is due to the unique crystal strucrue used in the meterail the vasitors are made of; namley semiconducting ceramic meterial, and they have intrincis nonlinear electrical properties; in other words the ressitance does not change preporcianl linear manner but rather in a non-linear one.
23- The varistor is an electronic component made of semiconductor ceramic material,with a crystal structure that has nonlinear instricsic elextric properites.When a voltage is applied to the varistor, its resistance decreases within a specific voltage range, allowing significant current to flow through

28-No, it varies with light intensity

29-The ressitence of the LDR varies with light intensityl; namely the ressitence increases the more intense the light is that it's detecting and the termpreture it's expreicneing.

30-Internal variables such as the meterial the LDR is made from,the elements in curcuit that are connected to the LDR all effect its resistence.

31- A photoresistor, also known as an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or photocell, is a gadget that changes its resistance based on how much light it’s exposed to. It’s made of semiconductors.
When light hits the photoresistor, it gets the electrons in the semiconductor excited and this lowers the resistance of the component.
But when the lights go out or it’s dim, the resistance of the photoresistor goes up; namely the darker it is, the higher the resistance.
